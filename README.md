# Mini_CLIPS-compiler
This is a personal project that I created during a semester for the Compilers and regular expressions lab on my university. The project is a compiler that works only on command line for now and uses flex,bison and tokens to identify each input. The input and output files are used to demonstrate functionality. To run the compiler just run the makefile that contains all the necessary commands. The compiler is for the Mini-CLIPS language a sublanguage created for the perpose of the lab based on the original CLIPS language used to create Experienced systems.
